The main thread (or UI thread) in a mobile app is responsible for handling all user interaction, and maintaining a feeling of responsiveness requires the app to respond to gestures and taps in real time. When a long running operation blocks the main thread, the app becomes unresponsive, impacting the quality of the user experience.

Decoding a compressed image from a format such as JPEG or PNG into a bitmap can be a long running operation, especially for large images. This issue type is created when we detect a long running image decoding operation on the main thread.

## Detection Criteria

This issue is detected when profiling is enabled, and we detect a function related to image decoding running on the main thread for at least 40ms. This threshold was chosen so that we see the function appear in a sufficient number of samples collected by the profile (~10ms per sample x 4 = ~40ms total) before we detect the issue.

## Function Evidence

On the issue details page, the **“Function Evidence”** section shows you more details about what caused the issue to be detected, including the following key information:

- **Transaction Name:** The name of the transaction that the issue was detected on
- **Suspect function:** The function that triggered the issue detection (in this case, an image decoding function)
- **Duration:** How long the function took to execute
- **Sample count:** How many consecutive samples collected by the profiler contained the function

To view the entire profile associated with the issue, click the **“View Profile”** button:

The profile will indicate where the suspect function was called from and the other functions that are called *by* the suspect function:

## Stack Trace

The **“Stack Trace”** section shows a full stack trace for where the detected image decoding function was called from:

## Example

### iOS

The following code renders an image by setting the `image` property of `UIImageView` . The image is not decoded when `UIImage.init(data:)` is called — the decoding occurs when the image is rendered on screen, which happens on the main thread. 

```swift
func showImage(data: Data) {
	imageView.image = UIImage(data: data)
}
```

The performance could be improved by using `[UIImage.preparingForDisplay()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimage/3750834-preparingfordisplay)` to prepare the image for display on a background queue before assigning the image to the image view on the main queue:

```kotlin
func showImage(data: Data) {
	DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async {
		let image = UIImage(data: data).preparingForDisplay()
		DispatchQueue.main.async {
			imageView.image = image
		}
	}
}
```

### Android

The following code calls `BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray` on the UI thread to decode an image and render it in an `ImageView`:

```kotlin
fun showImage(data: ByteArray) {
	imageView.setImageBitmap(BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray(data, 0, data.size))
}
```

The performance could be improved by moving the image decoding to a coroutine:

```kotlin
fun showImage(data: ByteArray) {
	lifecycleScope.launch(Dispatchers.IO) {
	  val bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray(data, 0, data.size)

    withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
      imageView.setImageBitmap(bitmap)
    }
  }
}
```
